# Week 12 Assignment for NU Coding Boot Camp

This assignment displays working knowledge of two NPM packages (inquirer & mqysql)
and also the process of communicating with a database. The user interface takes place
entirely inside of the console, and it emulates the process of buying products from
an online marketplace such as Amazon or Ebay.

The functionality of this assignment works successfully for parts 1 out of 3
of the boot camp assignment. Further changes to the version will be updated at the convenience
of the programming team. Thanks!
